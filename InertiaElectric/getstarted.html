               <h2>Introduction:</h2>
               <p>Power Flow Studies are an essential tool needed for the successful engineer to be able to analyze and design a power system. They are necessary for planning, operating, scheduling, and exchanging power between utilities. With the many inefficiencies seen around the world due to the aging grid, the demand for a transactive approach towards system analysis is a progressive step towards a more sustainable future. 
                For the fellow electrical engineer, this manual provides a guide to preparing data for analyzing n-bus systems and obtaining their results for study. The Power Flow tool designed by Inertia Electric uses Python for analysis to meet the growing popularity of the language, and solves the system with the best technique available, the Newton Raphson Method.  </p>

                <h2>User Input</h2>
                <p>To successfully use our power flow tool, the data must be formatted correctly. The user will need two CSV files for upload. It is essential that the files be named lines.csv and buses.csv for proper execution of our algorithm. </p>
               </div>
               <div class="naruto">
                <h3>lines.CSV</h3>
                <p>The first file, lines.csv, will contain the impedances in per unit specified on a 100MVA base. An example is provided below. Note that the variables are case-sensitive. They must be formatted as below. The inputs are summarized in the table.</p>

                <h3>buses.CSV</h3>
                <p>The second file, buses.csv, will contain the number of buses, which will need to be specified with only numerical values as shown below. In addition, it will need to specify the control type of the bus, the voltage magnitude if it exists, as well as the initial angles. Furthermore, the Load and Generator active and reactive powers at the bus will need to be specified according to the control type of the bus. </p>

               <p>The control type is essential. A Slack bus is specified with the code 1. The PQ bus is specified with code 0. Lastly, the PV bus is specified with code 2. 
                When creating your data sheets on Excel, make sure to save as a Comma Separated Value file (CSV). This way, python will be able to recognize the data and conduct the mathematical analysis. 
                The link for conducting the analysis will be given in an email. The instructions for working on the Cloud9 IDE environment should be referred to if not already. Once the files have been uploaded, hit run, and give the program some time to finish running. The user will know that the analysis was successful when they see on the left-hand side of the application, a new Excel file with the name ‘Output.xslx’. This file can then be downloaded by the user with all the desired values at each bus contained. The active and reactive powers seen at each bus, the voltage magnitude at each bus as well as its angle.
